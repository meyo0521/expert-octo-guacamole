        Schibsted Professional League System (SPLS) started its life as a HackDay project. It was initially planned as a basic solution for a single league purposes. Over time the project has evolved to a scalable platform that enables users to run multiple leagues, with reach statistics, advanced club search function and fixtures previews.</p>
        Here is a quick overview of the possibilities within the platform:
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub integration (login/register); </li>
          <li>User’s dashboard with global statistic, last matches & future matches preview and table preview; </li>
          <li>A list of games with table previews for finished, ongoing and planned leagues;</li>
          <li>Ability to save scores; </li>
          <li>A league view with statistics, past & upcoming fixtures; </li>
          <li>Automatic league split after closing a league (admin only), which enables to promote/demote players based on the league position; </li>
          <li>A list of users with individual dashboards (with the same functionality as personal ones) Intelligent Club search (try “Czelsi”, “Munsiengladbach”, and “London”); </li>
          <li>Ability to send a link to a specific league even to a non-logged users; </li>
          <li>Buttons at the top of the page that directs you to your current league page; </li>
        </ul>
